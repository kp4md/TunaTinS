 * The Tuna Tin S
 * by Bob Fontana AK3Y
 * 
 * Revised 31 December 2023 v2.1.0 by Carol Milazzo KP4MD
 *   -- NT7Sâ€™s Etherkit Si5351 library replaces the Adafruit Si5351 library.
 *   -- The Etherkit Si5351 library automates the PLL setup and offers continuous RF spectrum coverage from 4 kHz through 225 MHz.
 *   -- The Si5351 synthesizer now covers 15 amateur radio frequency bands with presets for QRP calling frequencies from 137 kHz (2200m) through 222 MHz (1.25m).
 *   -- Use the encoder control to adjust either the frequency or the tuning steps. Depress the control to alternate its mode between digit select and digit adjust.
 *   -- The tuning steps are now: Band change, 1 MHz, 100 kHz, 10 kHz, 1 kHz, 100 Hz, 10 Hz and 1 Hz, in either direction.
 *   -- You can now correct for Si5351 frequency reference crystal error to within 1 Hz at 10 MHz. 
 *   -- The companion TunaTinS_v2.1.0_Calibration sketch calculates and displays the parts per billion (ppb) crystal frequency correction factor.
 * Revised 01 January 2022 v2.0.0 by Carol Milazzo KP4MD
 *   -- added 630m & 6m
 *   -- cleaned up code and moved band constants into arrays 
 *   -- new PLL constants improve freq tracking on 60m and 12m
 * Revised 15 April 2021 by Carol Milazzo KP4MD
 *   -- added 160m, 17m and 12m
 *   -- corrected Calibration Offset for all bands
 * Revised 09 April 2021 by Carol Milazzo KP4MD
 *   -- added default QRP frequencies and band switching for 80, 40, 60, 30, 20, 15 and 10 meters
 *   -- added additional tuning steps (Band change, 10 kHz, 1 kHz, 100Hz, 10 Hz)
 *   -- added band indicator to display
 * Revised 27 March 2021
 *   -- added provision for 5 fixed frequency CW channels on 60 meters
 *   -- fixed EEProm code so that header changes to Band will trigger rewrite
 * Revised 24 February 2021
 *   -- added timing loop to EEPROM write; current settings will not be written to nonvolatile
 *   -- memory until DELAY_TIME has been exceeded.  This prevents too many writes to EEPROM which
 *   -- can only handle around 100,000 writes
 * Revised 21 February 2021
 *   -- added EEPROM storage of last used frequency and tuning rate (loads upon reboot)
 *   -- Note: if only tuning rate is changed, data is not stored
 * Revised 12 December 2020
 *   -- added an additional tuning increment (10Hz, 100Hz and 1000Hz)
 *   -- pressing switch toggles from 1000 --> 100 --> 10 --> 1000 Hz
 * Revised 10 December 2020
 *   -- added 30 meters to frequency bands
 *   -- modified display to indicate tuning rate
 * Revised 3 March 2020 -- added Transmit/Receive function to kill synthesizer output on Receive
 * Revised 25 February 2020 -- added Calibration Offset
 *   -- Note: calibration offset should be computed for each band of operation
